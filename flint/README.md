**Forus Labs' `dartanalyzer` configurations that are used internally in our Dart & Flutter projects.**

**Please view the [stable brunch](https://github.com/forus-labs/cauldron/tree/stable/flint/) for a production version.**

***
### Using the Lints

To use the lints, add the following dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flint: ^1.0.6  
```

Then, add a configuration to your `analysis_options.yaml`. The following will always include the latest version of said set.

```yaml
include: package:flint/dart/dev/analysis_options.yaml
```

A specific configuration version can be used via:
```yaml
include: package:flint/dart/dev/analysis_options.1.0.6.yaml
```
