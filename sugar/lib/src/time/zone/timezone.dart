/// A timezone that contains rules defining how an offset varies for a single timezone.
///
/// There are two types of [Timezone]s:
/// * Those that have a fixed offset at all points in time.
/// * Those that have offsets which vary across points in time, typically due to daylight savings time.
///
/// As of Sugar 4.0.0, most timezones in the 2025a TZ database are supported. This can be configured by replacing
/// [timezoneProvider]. Similarly, retrieval of the platform's timezone can be configured by replacing
/// [platformTimezoneProvider].
///
/// ## Caveats
/// By default, [Timezone.now] without specifying a timezone only works on Windows, MacOS, Linux and web. The
/// `Factory` timezone will be returned on all other platforms. This is due to limitations with `dart:ffi`. See
/// [Timezone.platformTimezoneProvider].
///
/// If you're feeling adventurous, consider using [stevia](https://github.com/forus-labs/cauldron/tree/master/stevia),
/// an experimental add-on package for retrieving the timezone on other Android and iOS.
///
/// ## Timezones Transitions
///
/// Obtaining the offset for a local date-time is not trivial. Due to timezone transitions, it is possible for a local
/// date-time to be ambiguous or invalid. There are three cases.
///
/// Normal, with one valid offset. This is the case for most of the year.
/// <br>
///
///
/// Gap, with zero offsets. This is when the clock jumps forward, when transitioning from winter to summer time.
/// If a local date-time fails in the middle of a gap, the offset after the gap, i.e. summer time, is returned.
///
/// ![Clock jumping forward](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Begin_CEST.svg/120px-Begin_CEST.svg.png)
/// <br>
///
///
/// Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back, typically when transitioning from summer to
/// winter time. If a local date-time falls in the middle of an overlap, the offset before the overlap, i.e. winter time,
/// is returned.
